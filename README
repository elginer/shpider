Shpider is a web automation library for Haskell.   It allows you to quickly write crawlers, and for simple cases ( like following links ) even without reading the page source.
    
It has useful features such as turning relative links from a page into absolute links, options to authorize transactions only on a given domain, and the option to only download html documents.

It also provides a nice syntax for filling out forms.

An example:

#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell

module ShpiderTest where

import Network.Shpider hiding (get)
import Network.Shpider.Curl.Opts

main = do
  (result, page) <- runShpiderWithOptions [CurlUserAgent "Windows Mozilla"] $ do
    download "http://browser.yellosoft.us/text.php"

  case result of
    Ok -> putStrLn "Ok"
    _ -> putStrLn "Error"

  putStrLn $ source page
